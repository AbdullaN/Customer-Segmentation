# Customer Personality Analysis 

The following repository hosts the final project of the course COSC621 

There are three folders. 

1. Code: It contains two files. Both files have the same information but one is a jupyter notebook of the project and the other is an HTML file of the project. To view the project code, I advice to download the files and view it on your local machine. Please avoid viewing it from github.

2. Dataset: it contains the dataset used in the project. 

3. Report and PPT: it contains the powerpoint of the project presented in class, and the full report of the project. 


Important note: Some models are based on randomness and thus, running the code might depict different results from the report.
